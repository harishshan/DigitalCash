Need of a payment system which enables the electronic transactions is growing at the
same time that the use of Internet is growing in our daily life. Present days electronic
payment systems have a major problem they cannot handle the security and the users

This report explains the concept of digital cash and discusses its properties. It shows how

Blind signatures make anonymity a reality in digital cash systems. However, when
, blind signatures raise such drawbacks as eCash deployed in digital cash systems such as 
bad scalability and unfair anonymity. In this thesis, efforts have been done to combine
 to build a NetCash digital signatures and a mechanism called “money-exchange” found in 
new digital cash system. In the new system, two forms of digital cash are introduced:
digital notes and digital coins. “Money-exchange” is extended to permit cash exchange
from one form to the other. At the side of the digital cash issuer, at least two databases
double-spending. The new digital cash system is secure due to its are maintained to detect 
deployment of both symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms. The combination
of blind signatures and the extended money-exchange mechanism offers unconditional
and fair anonymity, and it makes the system more scalable with the regards to the number
of clients served.
